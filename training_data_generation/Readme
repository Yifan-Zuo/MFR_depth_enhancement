This folder has two types of files, i.e., training_data_generator, shuffle_training_data. 
Training_data_generator file crops the correponding images into patches one by one, and writes these patches into h5 file. The original resolution of the HR image is 512*512 and the resolution of the patch is 128*128 with 64 pixels overlap, so one HR image maps to 49 patches. The default setting is 4500 images for training, and 500 images for validation. Therefore, 49*4500=220500 patches for training, and 49*500=24500 patches for validation.
Shuffle_training_data file shuffles the training and validation patches, respectively.
The user can modify the default setting of 5000 images for training and validation, and the numbers of patches for training and validation should be re-computed accordingly.
